# Overview of steps

Re-ran Phase 1 and Phase 2 trips through standardized version of Pamguard (2.02.07b). 

Generated acoustic studies for these new runs using functions within the `llamp` repository (`workflow_generate_acousticStudies.R`).

Created event reports for each trip using `workflow_generate_eventReports.R` in the `llamp` repository. 


`llx_combineEncounterTimes.R` was used to concatenate all the `LL##_encounterTimes.csv`s to build a fillable table for manual assessment. It was only used for Phase 3 data. Phase 2 was combined using copy-paste. 

Used combination of Triton to look at raw data, Pamguard viewer to look at raw data and detections, and event reports to assign species ID as possible. At a minimum each event was labeled as 'UO' if it was not a false killer whale. 'Pc' was used to label clear false killer whale events. Other events were labeled to species if it was obvious but this was a low priority (e.g., 'BW' used for any beaked whales with the possible species noted in the comments, 'Gg' for Risso's, 'Kspp' for *Kogia* species NBHF clicks, and 'Pm' for sperm whales). If it was not clear whether it was or was not 'Pc', it was labeled as 'X' to be excluded for training data. In other cases, additional labels like 'NA' or 'MIN' were given if the number of detected signals made it impossible to make a decision, also indicating that this event should be exluded from training data. Lastly, if there were very obvious false positive whistles (this occurred in some trips where there was a lot of instrument self noise) it was marked as such to be excluded from training data. 

Assessments of multiple analysts were adjudicated to make a final decision for the training data and saved in the `XXXXXX` spreadsheet. That spreadsheet was used in conjunction with `ll1_combine_acoustic_studies.R` to create the training dataset. 

Then `ll2_train_model.rmd` was used to train the longline model.
